## 🔐 **Security Update Required**

**IMPORTANT:** Update Firestore rules to allow public read access:

Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules and update:

```javascript
// Brands - Allow public read
match /brands/{brandId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create, update, delete: if isAdmin();
}

// Categories - Allow public read
match /categories/{categoryId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create, update, delete: if isAdmin();
}

// Products - Allow public read
match /products/{productId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create, delete: if isAdmin();
  allow update: if isAdmin() || isAuthenticated();
}
```

**Why:** So non-logged-in visitors can see brands and products on landing page.

**Security:** They can only READ, not modify anything!
