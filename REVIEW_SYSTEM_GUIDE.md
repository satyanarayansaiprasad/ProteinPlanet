## 🔥 Firestore Security Rules

The following rules have been added to allow public review submission:

// Reviews collection
match /reviews/{reviewId} {
  // Anyone can read reviews (public landing page needs this)
  allow read: if true;
  
  // Anyone can submit a review (public form)
  allow create: if true;
  
  // Only admins can update or delete reviews
  allow update, delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You MUST update your Firestore security rules by:
1. Opening `FIRESTORE_RULES_UPDATE.md`
2. Copying the complete ruleset
3. Pasting it in Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
4. Clicking "Publish"
